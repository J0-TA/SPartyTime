# SPartyTime

SpartyTime is a SPA based on Spotify API and allows any Spotify Premium user to create quickly a spotify playlist and share it with their people. The user can include address and other details. Who receives the sparty details will be able to add songs to the sparty playlist and, when the music starts, any new sparty's song will be added to the playback queue too! Useful for parties and road travels!
